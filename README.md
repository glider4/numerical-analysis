# numerical-analysis
 Numerical analysis in Python including Bisection method, Newton's method, Convergence test
 
 ## Results of Convergence Test
 Using SymPy, a wide range of functions could be put into the convergence script and tested to see which scheme
 would produce faster results: Bisection or Newton-Raphson.
